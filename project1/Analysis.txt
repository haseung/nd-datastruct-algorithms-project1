Task0: O(n) -> Time complexity is linear with n operations with each input is processed once through entire code.  

Task1: O(n) -> Time complexity is linear with n operations with each input is processed once through entire code. 

Task2: O(n) -> Time complexity is linear with n operations with each input is processed once through entire code.   

Task3: O(n log n) -> Time complexity is n log n due to use of list.sort() on list 'codesList'

Task4: O(n log n) -> Time complexity is n log n due to use of set fuction sorted() on set 'spam'
